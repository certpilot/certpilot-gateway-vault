# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# Built from this repository's root.
#
# It used to be built from the monorepo root, and the Dockerfile said so: every
# go.mod carried `replace github.com/certpilot/certpilot/pkg => ../pkg`, and a
# build context rooted at the module could not resolve a path above itself. So
# the context was the whole tree — core, frontend, migrations, two other
# gateways — handed to the daemon in full on every build.
#
# This module depends on a published certpilot-gateway-sdk now, so the context
# is the module. Smaller, and it no longer carries source that has nothing to do
# with this binary.
